# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In a day and age where technology continues to advance, I wanted to widen my skill set by taking on a new mindset and learning how code works and how it functions. While building this webpage I learned new skills that made it not only fun to execute in code but also a challenge. The problem I wanted to solve while building this webpage was to build a study guide so that new coding students can reference. In taking this prework course I not only got to learn about the difference between Hardware and Software along with basic commands. I got to take a look in to how HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript all work together to create user interface that anyone can interact with.
